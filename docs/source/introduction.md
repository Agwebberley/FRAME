### FRAME Introduction

Welcome to FRAME, a foundational library built on Django, specifically tailored to streamline and standardize application development within our company. FRAME isn’t a standalone framework; rather, it’s a robust Django library that integrates seamlessly into any Django project. By simply pulling from the FRAME library, developers gain access to a set of tools and templates that simplify the setup and maintenance of our applications.

#### What is FRAME?
FRAME stands for **Flexible Rapid Application Model for Efficiency**, designed as a Django-based library to accelerate the creation of high-quality, consistent applications. With FRAME, you’re still working within Django’s familiar environment, but with the added benefit of pre-configured, reusable components and configurations that align with our company’s standards. 

#### FRAME + Py_StarUML
One of FRAME’s powerful supporting tools is **Py_StarUML**, which handles the conversion from ERDs (Entity-Relationship Diagrams) directly into Django code. This integration means that the foundational structures of your applications—models, views, and forms—can be generated from visual schema designs, reducing boilerplate code and maintaining alignment with predefined standards from the start.

#### Why FRAME?
FRAME addresses the common challenges of Django development by:
1. **Simplifying Project Setup**: Instead of building each model, form, and view manually, FRAME automates much of the foundational setup, letting you focus on the unique business logic of each project.
2. **Ensuring Consistency Across Projects**: FRAME’s components are designed to create a uniform structure across different applications, making it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain projects over time.
3. **Enhancing Customization**: FRAME provides configurable options that can be easily modified in templates, removing the need for hard-coded solutions and allowing dynamic adjustments as projects evolve.

#### Where FRAME Fits In
FRAME fits as an extension to Django’s core functionality, acting as a toolkit within the existing Django ecosystem. You’re still creating a Django project, but by pulling in the FRAME library, you gain access to pre-defined configurations, reusable patterns, and automated model generation with Py_StarUML. FRAME is ideal for applications where:
- Speed and consistency are critical.
- A shared project structure is essential for maintainability.
- Developers want the flexibility to work within Django’s familiar ORM while benefiting from additional abstraction.

#### Key Components of FRAME
- **Auto-generated Models and Forms via Py_StarUML**: FRAME utilizes Py_StarUML to convert ERDs into Django code, saving setup time and ensuring adherence to our company’s standards.
- **Event-driven Logic**: With Django signals and listeners, FRAME enables event-based logic handling, so updates and new features require minimal direct code modifications.
- **Dynamic Configurations**: FRAME offers customizable options (e.g., `enable_search`, `list_title`, `enable_navigation`) that make it easy to tailor views, forms, and layouts without hard-coding.

#### Who Should Use FRAME?
FRAME is designed for any developer within our organization who works with Django and wants a standardized, efficient way to build applications. Whether building new applications or enhancing existing ones, FRAME’s tools and templates enable faster setup, better maintainability, and a consistent approach.

#### Conclusion
FRAME transforms the traditional Django experience by providing a set of predefined, customizable components that align with our internal standards. It’s not a separate framework but a library within Django that enhances your development process. By using FRAME, you’re leveraging Django’s powerful ORM while benefiting from tools like Py_StarUML and FRAME’s built-in configuration options, ensuring every project is both efficient and maintainable.

#### Next Steps
To get started with FRAME, first you will want to set up your development environment (see the [getting started guide](gettingstarted)) and then set up a hello world project (see the [hello world guide](helloworld.md)).
