# Appendix

## Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used in FRAME to help readers understand the specific components and tools available.

- **FRAME**: A Django-based library designed to streamline application development, offering pre-configured components and integration with Py_StarUML for model generation.
- **Py_StarUML**: A supporting tool for FRAME that converts ERD diagrams into Django models, simplifying model creation and aligning with FRAME’s standards.
- **BaseModel**: FRAME's foundational model class that extends Django’s `Model` class, providing additional functionality and a standardized structure.
- **BaseView**: A customizable view class that serves as the foundation for list, create, update, and detail views, with additional features like navigation support.
- **FormsetMixin**: A FRAME mixin for managing formsets in create and update views, allowing the inclusion of related model forms.
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**: A visual representation of data models, showing entities and their relationships. FRAME leverages ERDs through Py_StarUML to auto-generate Django models.
- **Master-Detail Views**: A view structure used to show a parent model alongside its related child models, providing a comprehensive view of linked data.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Settings in FRAME (such as `enable_search` and `list_title`) that allow models and views to be customized without hard-coded configurations.
- **Django Signals**: A feature in Django used by FRAME to implement event-driven logic, allowing for automatic updates when certain actions are performed.

## Configuration Reference

FRAME provides several configuration options that control various aspects of models, views, and forms. This section details these options for quick reference.

- **enable_search**: Enables or disables search functionality in list views. Accepts `True` or `False`.
- **list_title**: Sets a custom title for list views, displayed at the top of the list view template.
- **enable_navigation**: Enables navigation buttons for model detail and list views, improving user experience in multi-model applications.
- **form_layout**: Defines the layout of forms (e.g., `horizontal`, `vertical`), providing flexibility in form presentation.
- **permissions**: A dictionary specifying model-specific permissions (e.g., `{"create": True, "delete": False}`), allowing fine-grained access control.

## Tips and Best Practices

Here are some additional tips and best practices when working with FRAME:

1. **Use Py_StarUML for ERD-driven Development**: Whenever possible, start by creating ERDs to define your data models and relationships, then use Py_StarUML to auto-generate Django models. This ensures consistency and leverages FRAME’s strengths in standardized structure.
   
2. **Leverage Dynamic Configuration**: FRAME’s configuration options are designed to simplify customization without altering the underlying code. Make use of these settings in templates and views to adapt the application to specific requirements.

3. **Master-Detail Views for Complex Relationships**: For applications with complex data relationships, consider using Master-Detail views. This structure provides users with a cohesive view of related data, improving usability and data visualization.

4. **Use Signals for Event-driven Logic**: FRAME’s integration with Django signals is a powerful tool for creating responsive applications. Use signals to manage tasks like notifications, automatic field updates, and other cross-model operations.

## FAQs

**Q: What is the best way to start using FRAME in a new project?**  
A: Follow the steps in the Getting Started guide, which includes setup instructions and a Hello World example. Starting with a simple project helps you become familiar with FRAME’s main components and configurations.

**Q: Can I use FRAME without Py_StarUML?**  
A: Yes, while Py_StarUML simplifies model creation, FRAME can be used independently. You can manually define models within Django and still take advantage of FRAME’s views, configurations, and templates.

**Q: How can I contribute to FRAME?**  
A: Contributions are welcome! Visit the FRAME GitHub repository for information on how to submit issues, contribute code, or improve documentation.

**Q: Is FRAME compatible with other Django libraries?**  
A: FRAME is built to work within Django’s ecosystem, and most Django libraries should be compatible. However, for specialized integrations, check FRAME’s documentation or the compatibility notes on the specific library.
